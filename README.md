This repository contains the skeletons as they're used within the StdMod project.

If you want to set up a module that is streamlined with the other StdMod modules you're suggested to clone any of the templates linked to in this repository and use it as the basis of your module.

Please note, currently (October 2013) these skeletons are still in development and subject to change.

Skeletons that have currently been foreseen:
- Standard module:	Modules that are used to configure and manage one specific application.
- Stacks: 		Modules that stack a combination of other stacks and makes them work together.
- More?:		TBD
